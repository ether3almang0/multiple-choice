# multiple-choice
I read the novel "Multiple Choice" by Alejandro Zambra my freshman year at Cooper Union. This class was and has been by far one of my favorite English, providing one of the best reading selections I've ever been required to read, (and actually enjoyed reading) for a grade. The formatting fascinated me, as I'm not sure if the order mattered, or the answers mattered. It kind of reminded of certain part's of Arundathi Roy's fictive works. (In "The God of Small Things" where Rahel reads Esthappens old English workbooks and in "The Ministry of Utmost Happiness" where Garson Hobart finds Tilo's files, which happened to be in the form of multiple choice, on Kashmir). I'm not really sure how I'm going to go about this project. After we as a class had finished the novel, the professor assigned us to convey a story in an unconventional format, they didn't necessarily mean Zambra's format just in a way that a story isn't typically written. I'm honestly not super proud of what I submitted, it was corny and definitely half assed. So I guess this is my reattempt, I think I'm stalling by writing this description. I am not really and artist nor a developer, but I wish to try.
